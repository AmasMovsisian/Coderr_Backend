# Coderr Backend API

Coderr is a REST API backend for a freelance marketplace platform, built with Django and Django REST Framework.

The platform connects clients with developers. Clients can publish project requests, while developers can offer their services and showcase their expertise. This repository contains the backend implementation, including business logic, data management, authentication, authorization, and REST API endpoints. The frontend application communicates with this backend exclusively through these endpoints.

# Frontend

This repository contains the backend application only.

The frontend application is maintained in a separate repository and communicates with this backend through the provided REST API endpoints.

The frontend repository can be found here:

# Installation & Configuration

## 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmasMovsisian/Coderr_Backend.git
cd Coderr_Backend
```

## 2. Create a Virtual Environment

### Windows

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### macOS / Linux

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 4. Create Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root directory.

Generate a secure Django secret key:

```bash
python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"
```

Add the generated key to your `.env` file:

```env
SECRET_KEY=your_generated_secret_key
DEBUG=True
```

### Local Development

```env
DEBUG=True
```

### Production

```env
DEBUG=False
```

> Never commit your `.env` file to GitHub.

## 5. Apply Database Migrations

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

## 6. Create a Superuser (Optional)

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

## 7. Start the Development Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The API will be available at:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

### Django Admin

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
```

## 8. Run the Test Suite

Before starting development, verify the installation by running the test suite.

### Standard Test Execution

```bash
python manage.py test
```

### Faster Test Execution (Recommended)

Run the test suite using the optimized test settings:

```bash
python manage.py test --settings=core.test_settings
```

This setup greatly reduces test execution time by avoiding the development database and using a much faster password hashing algorithm during testing.

### Included Test Coverage

The project includes automated tests covering:

* Registration
* Login
* Profiles
* Offers
* Orders
* Reviews
* Permissions
* API behavior

### Run All Tests

```bash
python manage.py test --settings=core.test_settings
```

### Run Tests for a Specific Application

```bash
python manage.py test accounts --settings=core.test_settings
python manage.py test offers --settings=core.test_settings
python manage.py test orders --settings=core.test_settings
python manage.py test reviews --settings=core.test_settings
```

### Run Tests with Increased Verbosity

```bash
python manage.py test --settings=core.test_settings --verbosity=2
```

Each application contains its own API layer including:

* Serializers
* Views
* Permissions
* URL configurations
* Tests

# Authentication

Coderr uses **Django REST Framework Token Authentication**.

After successful registration or login, the API returns an authentication token.

### Example Response

```json
{
    "token": "your_token",
    "username": "exampleUser",
    "email": "example@example.com",
    "user_id": 1
}
```

Include the token in all protected requests:

```http
Authorization: Token your_token
```
